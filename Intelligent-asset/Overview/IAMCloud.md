# Overview: IAM Cloud

[**IAM Cloud**](https://www.intelligentassetmanager.com/) is a cloud service hosted by Microsoft. During a Microsoft SAM Engagement run by a SAM Partner, Microsoft-only software deployment data [**consolidated through UI in a CIDC**](UI.md) can be uploaded to IAM Cloud to produce the Microsoft-certified Effective Deployment Position (EDP) and Effective License Position (ELP). At this moment only [**Microsoft SAM Partners**](key-users.md) have access to IAM Cloud.

If you are a SAM Partner and is running a SAM Engagement in partnership with Microsoft, you are ultimately responsible for reviewing and ensuring completeness and accuracy of your SAM engagements, including all data entered into and reported out out of the IAM Cloud. You should support your customers understanding the [**IAM Data Usage and Privacy Terms**](https://aka.ms/iamdatausage), singing off the customer [**IAM Consent**](../Tutorials/SAM-Partners/Admin.md) and providing the Letter of Engagement from your customer, according to the [**Microsoft SAM Partner Program Guide**](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/Licensing/software-asset-management#Navigated_Rich_Text_Node_2_SAM_Incentives).
