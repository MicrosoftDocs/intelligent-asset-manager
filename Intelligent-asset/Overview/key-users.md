# Overview: IAM Key Users and Stakeholders

# IAM Main Stakeholders

- IT Staff and consultants that are involved with Software Asset Management in their organization or that of their customers, should use IAM to measure actual usage, support the decision-making progress, and profit from value services provided by IAM-certified partners.  

- Customers who use IAM in conjunction with an accredited partner may receive benefits such as audit risk reduction and a fresh start with Microsoft licensing.

- Microsoft SAM Partners must use IAM to produce an EDP and ELP in the context of the SAM Incentive Program or SAM Managed Service Program. See [**Microsoft SAM Partners**](https://aka.ms/mssampartners) for more information.

- Integrated Solution Vendors (ISV) who offer complementary expertise and services should integrate their respective solution with IAM to expand their offerings and accelerate solutions for customers by making use of services from other certified ISV.
