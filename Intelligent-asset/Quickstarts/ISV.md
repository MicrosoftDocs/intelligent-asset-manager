# Quickstart: Universal Inventory ISVs

## Introduction

This guide explains the steps and process for [**Microsoft ISVs Partners**](../Overview/key-users.md) to build the integration from their Inventory/Value solutions with Universal Inventory application and standard.

This is a self-guided process and largely relies on <ins>*the ISV*</ins> to initiate the work and complete all the required steps. Please read and follow the processes contained in this guide.

## Important: ISV Commitment to promote Microsoft’s SAM Value Messaging

IAM is designed to facilitate achieving the core Microsoft SAM goals in delivering data driven insights that help customers increase the value of their Microsoft investments and make correct technology decisions.

- Please, review the detailed information on Microsoft’s SAM objectives can be found [here](https://blogs.partner.microsoft.com/mpn/myth-busting-software-asset-management-and-compliance-audits/)
- Also, it is ideal to check the [Microsoft SAM Official Page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sam/default.aspx) before you start

The IAM team will be promoting ISVs who have achieved UI integration points as part of the marketing of the platform.

In order to be included in these promotions your UI integration work must include:

1. A dedicated landing page on your web site outlining the UI integration (within two clicks of your home page)
2. Information on how your users execute against this integration
3. Prominent promotion of Value substantively aligning to Microsoft’s SAM Value messaging

Examples of incorrect, non-aligned messaging would be:

- Any equating of SAM with Audit
- Use of the threat or implication of licensing incompliance to sell SAM deliverables
- Focusing on GAP identification and collection

The IAM team will discontinue work with any partner found to acting outside of these guidelines.

## Integration: Step by Step Process

1. **Confirm to Microsoft your intent to proceed with the UI integration process by**:  

   **Sending an email to**: SAM-UI@microsoft.com with the following included:
   - Thoroughly reviewing the full content of [ISVs Tutorial](../Tutorials/ISVs/introduction.md)
   - Company Name
   - Country
   - Primary and secondary contacts name and e-mail addresses
   - Whether your tool will be a UI Data Provider, Data Consumer and/or Normalization tool.
   > [!NOTE]
   > You do not have to integrate all 3 UI functionalities at the same time, you are very welcome to start with one and later on integrate other functionalities if that is of your wish.

   A Microsoft representative will then reply confirming your request has been received and introduce you to the technical UI developers that will support you during the integration process.

2. **Complete tasks described on the [ISVs Tutorial](../Tutorials/ISVs/introduction.md)**:

    - Complete all the required technical tasks to integrate your solution with UI following the instructions contained on the [ISVs Tutorial](../Tutorials/ISVs/introduction.md).

3. **Get your results validated by the UI team**

   After you have completed your work and passed the self-validation test:

   **Send an email to**: SAM-UI@microsoft.com with the following included:

   - Company Name
   - Tool Name
   - If you are a Data Provider – include a copy of the validated Inventory database for Microsoft to test against
   - If you are a Data Consumer – Please indicate you have successfully integrated your solution and are able to retrieve UI Database for use

4. **Microsoft will review your submissions according to the criteria established on the [ISVs Tutorial](../Tutorials/ISVs/introduction.md)**

   This validation work can take up to 1 calendar week. After validation is complete you will receive a notification e-mail about the findings are some suggestions to improve your integration and make sure you are following the quality guidelines established by Microsoft. Once this refinement stage is done, you will be notified via e-mail that your integration has been completed.

5. **Integration completed: Marketing process**

   - Microsoft will ask via e-mail for some information to be able to include your logo and link on the [official list of UI integrated ISVs](https://aka.ms/samiam)
   - Respond to Microsoft’s request for Logo file and Logo Usage approval.
   - Supply a link or a copy of the directions you will supply to your end users on how UI integration works.
   - Supply URL of your final page with the directions described on the topic above.
   - Once received, Microsoft will add your logo into the [official list of UI integrated ISVs](https://aka.ms/samiam) and you will receive a UI PR Kit to support any marketing content you wish to develop.

   Note: You may be required to re-validate results based on future UI updates.
