# Quickstart: Microsoft SAM Engagement Managers

## Getting Started

If you are a Microsoft Engagement Manager with the goal of helping your SAM Partners leverage the IAM platform with their customers, we suggest reading the IAM documentation described below for full readiness related to the IAM platform.

1. First, understand the main concepts and value provided by the [**Intelligent Asset Manager**](../Overview/IAM.md) platform, as well as the main functionalities of [**Universal Inventory**](../Overview/UI.md), the [**IAM Cloud**](../Overview/IAMCloud.md) platform and the main [**IAM key users and stakeholders**](../Overview/key-users.md).
2. It is recommended that you understand the full process of how to use **Universal Inventory** to create a standardized inventory, which applies to any customer of SAM Partner running the application, by checking the [**UI Quickstart**](UI.md) guide and follow its training guide.
3. Then, understand what work is involved in being a SAM Partner and what work they do within the IAM Cloud platform in order to deliver an Established Deployment Position (EDP) and (when needed) and Established Licensing Position (ELP) documents, through the content outlined on the [**SAM Partner Quickstart**](SAM-Partners.md) guide.
4. Understand how any ISM key user and stakeholder should reach out to the [**IAM support team and community platforms**](../Sup_Comm.md).
