## IAM Workflow Overview

Here are the high-level [SAM Partner](../Overview/key-users.md) steps that make up IAM end-to-end Engagement.

1. Determine whether the Engagement will require an Effective Licensing Position (ELP) document. If yes, will it be created using Microsoftâ€™s Centralized ELP Service or self-created.
1. Provide a copy of the signed Letter of Engagement to the Microsoft SAM Engagement Manager.
1. Collect [Customer Engagement consent](../Tutorials/SAM-Partners/SAM-Partner-admin.md) through the IAM Cloud platform.
1. Start working with Customer on [inventory data collection](../Tutorials/UI/inventory.md)
1. Load inventory data and create a Clean Inventory Data Contract (CIDC) using [Universal Inventory](../Quickstarts/UI.md).
1. Read the [IAM Cloud preparation Tutorial](../Tutorials/SAM-Partners/preparation.md) section for the SAM Partners and learn how to work with the [IAM Cloud administrative](../Tutorials/SAM-Partners/SAM-Partner-admin.md) tasks.
1. [Encrypt the CIDC](../Tutorials/UI/inventory.md) using UI.
1. Upload an encrypted CIDC into the IAM Cloud and complete an [Established Deployment Position (EDP)](../Tutorials/SAM-Partners/EDP.md).
1. *(Optional step)* Complete an [ELP yourself](../Tutorials/SAM-Partners/ELP.md) or use the [Microsoft's ELP Service](../Tutorials/SAM-Partners/ELPS.md).
1. *(Optional step)* Use CIDC to gain Value reporting from integrated offerings.
1. Make sure you also check the [**IAM support team and community platforms**](../Sup_Comm.md) section in order to know how to reach out for support in case you run into issues when following the readiness procedures outlined into this platform.
