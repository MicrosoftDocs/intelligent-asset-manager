NOTE: A SAM Partner Admin will be needed to access IAM to accept the EULA. Until this is done, the SAM Engagement Manager will not be able to add Engagements to the SAM Partner Organization.

## Creating New Engagements and Assigning it to a Partner Organization

For a Partner to work on an Engagement within Intelligent Asset Manager the SAM EM must first create and assign it to the Partner Organization:

- The correct MSX Engagement type must be filled out for the CRM Opportunity ID to flow through to IAM. These opportunities start with ‘SAM&C : SAM’. When that is done, it can take up to 2 hours for it to be pulled into IAM. Once done, the SAM EM will be able to create the Engagement.
- The SAM Partner Organization must exist in the Geo for where the CRM Opportunity ID is created. For Example, if the CRM Opportunity is created in Vietnam, then there must be a SAM Partner Organization in Vietnam. If there is no SAM Partner Organization, then the SAM EM will not be able to see the CRM Opportunity ID to add the Engagement to the SAM Partner Organization.
- The SAM Partner Organization must have a SAM Partner Admin that has logged into IAM and accepted the online EULA. If this did not occur, then the SAM EM will not be able to see the CRM Opportunity ID to add the Engagement to the SAM Partner Organization.
- Copy of the signed Letter of Engagement
- MLS (Optional for when an ELP is desired)

After saving the SAM EM user is sent back to the Engagement Dashboard where the newly created Engagement is available to start.
