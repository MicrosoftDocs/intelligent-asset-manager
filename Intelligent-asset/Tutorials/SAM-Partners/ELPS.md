# Microsoft's Effective Licensing Position (ELP) Service

## Microsoft’s Free Centralized ELP Service

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As stated above if this option is chosen, the EDP should not be finalized by the Partner, Partner should follow the steps below with EDP created but not finalized.*

1. Requirements for utilizing the Centralized ELP Service:

   - Customer’s consent accepted for the “ELP as a Service” Engagement type
   - Inventory data must be completed via one of the following options:
     - MAP Toolkit + AD + VMWare
     - Movere + AD + VMWare
     - Additional inventory tools can be used
   - CIDC provided must not contain any ed[“Red cell” errors](EDP.md) and must follow Minimum EDP Quality Standards described above.
   - Other Data Template (ODT) uploaded with complete with License positions not captured in the MLS as described above
   - MLS in English (this needs to be provided by your SAM EM):
     - Must contain all Customer Account Names
     - Must contain only the Licenses active in the country where the Engagement is running
     - Note: ELP Service considers only Effective License Quantity in the License Summary Tab
   - MLS and ODT must be previously reviewed by Partner, Customer and SAM EM to ensure data consistency and quality
   - Partner should be able to engage with Business Desk in English

1. Once you have fulfilled all the above requirements, you should reach out to our ELP Service Business Desk (servicedeskmicrosoft@sam-live.com) requesting your ELP to be produced. Please provide: **Partner Organization Name, Partner Contact Email, Engagement Name and Opportunity ID**.
1. Business Desk will perform a check on the pre-requisites. If any documents are missing, you will be communicated, and the service will be paused until those are provided.
1. CIDC Password will be requested to Partner – this required so Business Desk can visualize the inventory data content and validate it against the quality requirements.
1. The Business Desk will perform initial Engagement data quality review:
   - If quality and content are sufficient, then ELP creation will be performed through the service
   - If quality and/or content are missing or gaps exist, Partner will be required to provided additional details on missing content/quality remediation needed
   - Additional emails or phone calls might be established as needed

1. Partner will receive from Business Desk a document stating the ELP Licensing Logic and more information regarding the Customer’s environment, as well as the created ELP on the IAM tool. Both should be reviewed and signed off by the Partner/Customer.
1. Partner should proceed to [Finalize ELP](ELP.md#finalizing-elp) once it meets all Partner’s requirements.

>[!NOTE] 
>No data may be sent directly from partner/Customer to Service Desk. ALL data must originate from IAM, so if changes are needed on CIDC/ODT/MLS, those documents will have to be re-uploaded into IAM Cloud.  
The SLA for the entire Centralized ELP Service desk process outlined above is up to 3 business days in total, provided the data handoff from the partner is complete and clear. Additional time may be needed if there are gaps in handoff or if further partner & Service Desk collaboration is required for clarification purposes.  
SLA clock will pause during Partner review.  
If partner does not respond or fails to complete remediation plan within three business days (or other timeline agreed upon in above dialogue), the Service Desk will withdraw the Engagement from the Centralized ELP Service and notify Partner.  
Service Desk hours will be Monday to Friday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. CET.
