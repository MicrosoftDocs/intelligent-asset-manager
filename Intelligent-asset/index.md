# What is Intelligent Asset Manager?

Intelligent Asset Manager (IAM) is Microsoft's next-generation platform for Software Asset Management. IAM helps organizations make good technology decisions by maintaining a quality inventory of software products in use, and ensuring this inventory can be used for technology decision modeling.

IAM consists of the following components:

- **[Universal Inventory](universal-inventory/what-is-universal-inventory.md)** (UI) is a free application you can install on-premise to gather and process data about the entire IT infrastructure. UI does not scan the IT infrastructure, but integrates with existing solutions to import data from sources such as the Active Directory, well-known discovery tools, asset management solutions, virtualization systems, and cloud subscriptions, and stores the consolidated inventory in a database on-premise.

- **IAM Cloud** is a cloud service hosted by Microsoft. Data stored in UI can -but does not have to- be uploaded to IAM Cloud to produce the Microsoft-certified Effective Deployment Position (EDP) and Effective License Position (ELP).  
  
  At this moment only Microsoft SAM Partners have access to IAM Cloud.

## Who should use Intelligent Asset Manager?

- IT Staff and consultants that are involved with Software Asset Management in their organization or that of their customers, should use IAM to measure actual usage, support the decision-making progress, and profit from value services provided by IAM-certified partners.  

  Customers who use IAM in conjunction with an accredited partner may receive benefits such as audit risk reduction and a fresh start with Microsoft licensing.

- Microsoft SAM Partners must use IAM to produce an EDP and ELP in the context of the SAM Incentive Program or SAM Managed Service Program. See [Microsoft SAM Partners](https://aka.ms/mssampartners) for more information.

- Integrated Solution Vendors (ISV) who offer complementary expertise and services should integrate their respective solution with IAM to expand their offerings and accelerate solutions for customers by making use of services from other certified ISV.
