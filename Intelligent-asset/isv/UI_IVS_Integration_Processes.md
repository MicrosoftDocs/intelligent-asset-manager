# Universal Inventory Integration for ISVs – Onboarding Guide

## Introduction

This guide explains the steps and process for ISVs to build connectors to <ins>Provide</ins> or <ins>Consume</ins> inventory data with the Universal Inventory (UI) component of the Intelligent Asset Management (IAM) platform.

This is a self-guided process and largely relies on <ins>*the ISV*</ins> to initiate the work and complete all the required steps. Please read and follow the processes contained in this guide.

## ISV Commitment to promote Microsoft’s SAM Value Messaging

IAM 2018 is designed to facilitate achieving the core Microsoft SAM goals in delivering data driven insights that help customers increase the value of their Microsoft investments and make correct technology decisions.

Detailed information on Microsoft’s SAM objectives can be found here:

- [https://blogs.partner.microsoft.com/mpn/myth-busting-software-asset-management-andcompliance-audits/](https://blogs.partner.microsoft.com/mpn/myth-busting-software-asset-management-andcompliance-audits/)
- [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sam/default.aspx](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sam/default.aspx)

The IAM team will be promoting ISVs who have achieved UI integration points as part of the marketing of the platform.

In order to be included in these promotions your UI integration work must include:

1. A dedicated landing page on your web site outlining the UI integration (within two clicks of your home page)
2. Information on how your users execute against this integration
3. Prominent promotion of Value substantively aligning to Microsoft’s SAM Value messaging

Examples of incorrect, non-aligned messaging would be:

- Any equating of SAM with Audit
- Use of the threat or implication of licensing incompliance to sell SAM deliverables
- Focusing on GAP identification and collection

The IAM team will discontinue work with any partner found to acting outside of these guidelines.

## Step by Step Processes

1. **Confirm to Microsoft your intent to proceed with the UI integration process by**:  

   **Sending an email to**: SAM-UI@microsoft.com with the following included:
   - Thoroughly reviewing the [UI ISV Onboarding Guide](intelligent-asset/isv/index.md)
   - Company Name
   - Country
   - Primary and secondary contacts name and e-mail addresses
   - Whether your tool will be a UI Data Provider, Data Consumer and/or Normalization tool. 
    Note: You do not have to integrate all 3 functionalities at the same time, you are very welcome to start with one and later on integrate other functionalities if that is of your wish.
    
   A Microsoft representative will then reply confirming your request has been received and introduce you to the technical UI developers that will support you during the integration process.
 
2. **Complete tasks described on the [UI ISV Onboarding Guide](intelligent-asset/isv/index.md)**:

    - Complete all the required technical tasks to integrate your solution with UI following the instructions contained on the [UI ISV Onboarding Guide](intelligent-asset/isv/index.md).

3. **Get your results validated by the UI team**

   After you have completed your work and passed the self-validation test:

   **Send an email to**: SAM-UI@microsoft.com with the following included:

   - Company Name
   - Tool Name
   - If you are a Data Provider – include a copy of the validated Inventory database for Microsoft to test against
   - If you are a Data Consumer – Please indicate you have successfully integrated your solution and are able to retrieve UI Database for use

4. **Microsoft will review your submissions according to the criteria established on the [UI ISV Onboarding Guide](isv/index.md)**

   This validation work can take 1 calendar week. After validation is complete you will receive a notification e-mail about the findings are some suggestions to improve your integration and make sure you are following the quality guidelines established by Microsoft. Once this refinement stage is done, you will be notified via e-mail that your integration has been completed.

5. **Send Microsoft your logo, use permission and link to more information**

   - Microsoft will ask via e-mail for some information to be able to include your logo and link on the official IAM 2018 landing page (aka&#46;ms/SAMIAM).
   - Respond to Microsoft’s request for Logo file, Logo approval use and more information in substantially the same format as outlined below in Additional Information.
   - Supply a link or a copy of the directions you will supply to your end users on how UI integration works
   - Once received, Microsoft will add your logo into the official aka&#46;ms/SAMIAM list of UI integrated ISVs and you will receive a UI PR Kit to support any marketing content you wish to develop

   Note: You may be required to re-validate results based on future UI updates.

## Additional Information

**For questions or comments on the IAM ISV integration process please email**: SAM-UI@microsoft.com

More information on both Microsoft SAM Practices and IAM can be found in the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/Licensing/software-asset-management#Navigated_Rich_Text_Node_11) page.

**Logo Use Consent Request sent from Microsoft to you for Logo Usage Approval**

I was informed by our technical team that the &lt;&lt;insert company name&gt;&gt; application has passed the compatibility tests for integration with our Universal Inventory application.

Microsoft would like approval to use the &lt;&lt;insert company&gt;&gt; logo for inclusion on Microsoft&#46;com/sam website, Intelligent Asset Manager tab, under the IAM/Universal Inventory-compatible ISVs. A mockup of how we would like to use it is outlined below. If you will allow us to use the &lt;&lt;insert company&gt;&gt; logo, please reply to this email with your approval.

1. A high-resolution logo we can use on our webpage to confirm your compatibility with IAM2018. (In .ai format)
1. An email statement confirming your consent for us to use your logo on our webpage (Microsoft&#46;com/sam) and that you agree to the terms below.
1. A link to a webpage where people can find further information regarding your tools’ compatibility with IAM2018 and Universal Inventory

   - Download link for your application (or instructions on how to get it)
   - Versions/editions of your software that are compatible with UI/IAM
   - Training/guidance for how to export inventory data from your tooling to IAM2018 and/or how to import from IAM 2018 (user guides, videos, etc)

Example of how logo will be used:

![Example Logos](media/Example_Logos.jpg)

Upon your email approval, and in addition to the approval granted above, Microsoft has the right to publish, use, reference and display the logo as follows: (i) on Microsoft’s internal and external websites; (ii) in printed and digital publications; (iii) in printed media distributed by Microsoft internally or externally; (iv) in slides, brochures and other marketing collateral materials; and (v) as a reference when communicating with analysts, the press and the general public. Termination for convenience: you may terminate Microsoft’s rights to use the logo specifically granted in this email at any time without cause by giving 30 days’ notice by email to IAMSupport@microsoft.com. For clarity, such email notice of termination will not affect Microsoft’s rights to use your company’s logos granted in any other agreement or arrangement between your company and Microsoft.
