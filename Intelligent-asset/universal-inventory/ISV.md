# Microsoft SAM - Universal Inventory

Universal Inventory (UI) is Microsoft's next-generation tool for inventory collection in support  of Software Asset Management. UI is a component of Microsoft Intelligent Asset Manager 2018 (IAM 2018), Microsoft's platform for managing and leveraging SAM engagements. IAM 2018 supports our Program goals of helping our Customers make good technology decisions by:
1. Ensuring a quality inventory of Microsoft products in use, is acquired during engagements, and

2. Ensuring this quality inventory can be used for technology decision modeling.

UI enables Partners to automate, standardize, and secure data collection by integrating with several well-known inventory collection tools in the market. UI also enables the standardized inventory to be reused in market-ready Value tools from ISV's for use in Value Engagements.

UI is the result of Microsoft's collaboration with service vendors in several fields (ISV). This site explains how Inventory Providers and Inventory Consumers can integrate their solution with UI.
