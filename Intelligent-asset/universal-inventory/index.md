# What is Universal Inventory?

Universal Inventory (UI) is the component of Intelligent Asset Manager that is used to gather and standardize data about your IT infrastructure into a holistic inventory, stored in a database on-premise.

You can use UI to:

- Gather data from a variety of sources, including Active Directory, SCCM, virtualization systems, asset management solutions, or cloud subscriptions

- Verify that your inventory is up-to-date and exclude out-of-scope items

- Normalize consolidated data

- Export data to value service providers to help optimize your software investments.
